# The-F1-Project
I wanted to play around, sharpen my skills on something new. I'm still not sure what this project is going to be about, but let's start!

For now, I'm just going to give a brief overview. Will keep updating this as and when we progress.

As of today, the goal is to deep dive into F1 race strategy nd performance analytics. We will analyze the two most critical factors in modern F1 racing: Tire strategy an Driver Consistency. and eventually develop a model to predict podiums.

Project Overview (rough draft):

• Data Source: Ergast API – historical F1 data (race results, lap times, pit stops, etc.)

• Database: SQLite (local file database, using Python’s built-in sqlite3).

• Analysis: SQL (via SQLite) and Python (pandas/numpy) for data manipulation.

• Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Python scripts) for modeling.

• Visualization: Power BI Desktop (connected via SQLite ODBC or CSV exports).

• Version Control: Git (with Git Bash for command-line operations).
